      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello, I’m Baris Barut, an IT major at the University of Central Florida. I aspire to build a career in networking and software development, leveraging my expertise in coding (Java, C) and networking, with plans to earn my Network+ certification soon. My diverse experiences as a bartender, Marine Biology spokesperson, and printing press operator have helped me develop strong skills in public speaking, organization, and quick thinking. Additionally, my work as a Marine Biology spokesperson provided me with the invaluable opportunity to speak at governmental events, including addressing the Governor.</p>

      <p>The first thing I noticed was how cluttered the old Forbes website felt...</p>
      <p>Another major difference was the visual design...</p>
      <p>The way content was presented also stood out...</p>
      <p>One of the most jarring aspects of the outdated site...</p>
      <p>Overall, visiting the older version of Forbes was like stepping back in time...</p>
