      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello, I’m Baris Barut, an IT major at the University of Central Florida. I aspire to build a career in networking and software development, leveraging my expertise in coding (Java, C) and networking, with plans to earn my Network+ certification soon. My diverse experiences as a bartender, Marine Biology spokesperson, and printing press operator have helped me develop strong skills in public speaking, organization, and quick thinking. Additionally, my work as a Marine Biology spokesperson provided me with the invaluable opportunity to speak at governmental events, including addressing the Governor.</p>

      <h3>Reflecting on Forbes' Evolution</h3>
      <p>
        Exploring how Forbes’ website has evolved over the years was an eye-opening experience. I’ve always looked to Forbes, particularly their 30 Under 30 list, as a source of inspiration for understanding the skills and traits of successful individuals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seeing how their website has changed over time added another layer of appreciation for the brand. It was fascinating to see how web design has evolved over time, transforming into the seamless and intuitive experience we now expect every time we go online.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first thing I noticed was how cluttered the old Forbes website felt. The dense text and overwhelming number of links lacked the simplicity and structure we now expect, making navigation feel cumbersome.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s incredible how much more emphasis modern web design places on aesthetics to keep users interested. My friend, a UX designer, highlighted responsive design and clean layouts as essential advancements.
