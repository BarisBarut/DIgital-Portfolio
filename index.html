    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello, Iâ€™m Baris Barut, an IT major at the University of Central Florida. I aspire to build a career in networking and software development, leveraging my expertise in coding (Java, C) and networking, with plans to earn my Network+ certification soon. My diverse experiences as a bartender, Marine Biology spokesperson, and printing press operator have helped me develop strong skills in public speaking, organization, and quick thinking.</p>
